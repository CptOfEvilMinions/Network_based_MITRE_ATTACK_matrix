## Malware/Threat actors

{% assign malwares = 'DarkComet,Operation Cleaver' | split: ',' %}
{% assign threat_actors = site.data.threat_actors %}

{% include threat_table.html %}


## Mitigations

One mitigation is to rate limit the amount of unqiue connections from a source IP address or to a destination port.

## Detections

Using the BRO `conn.log` to look for a large number of connections to a particular host with a `conn_state` set to `S0`(Connection attempt seen, no reply.).

## Toolkit
